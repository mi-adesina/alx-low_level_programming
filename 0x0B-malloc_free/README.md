malloc (short for "memory allocation") is a function in the C programming
language that is used to dynamically allocate memory during the runtime of
a program. It's part of the standard C library (stdlib.h) and is commonly
used when you need to allocate memory for variables, arrays, or data
structures whose size isn't known at compile time.
